Summary: Following along with Brad and Florin doing 50 JavaScript projects to get better at JavaScript.

This is really sinking into me that JS can be super powerful as a toggle between two different CSS designs, especially when adding in transitions. I made this mini project Darth Vader themed because, why not?
